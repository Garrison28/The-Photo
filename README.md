### Day 1/ Day 2
I planned my routes and model schemas, determined the relationships between
my models and made my User stories.

### Day 4
Finished writing my routes
![index.js](./routes/index.js)
I also started working on my react components and making the react carousel component.
![Carousel.jsx](./client/src/carosel/Carousel.jsx)

### Day 5
Finished working on my front end, had a really hard time with cloudinary and
in the end was unable to use it in my project, but I have set it as a goal to
incorperate in my app post cohort as one of my main stretch goals.
